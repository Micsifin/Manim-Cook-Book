# Manim Cook Book
## Warning: project still underway

This project began as a way to learn Manim, and a good way to begin was making a "cook book" for the Manim library (link), despite heaps of online content.

This project is a "cook book", much like there is a cook book for the R programming language (link). This project describes short "recepies", to get your desired result.
